# Credits
I will be using the following guide that I used in the past to
learn the basics of Django, but will largely be creating original 
code and updating this project as my skills grow.

View the use case diagrams, UML diagrams, and wireframes in the wiki.

I have also used the following blog to guide me through a couple 
syntax-only issues I could not work my way through alone, but because 
the foundation of my program is different, debugging and designing 
is still largely on my own.
